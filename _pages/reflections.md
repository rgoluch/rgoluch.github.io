## Relevant Course Projects
<!-- ====== -->

### SE 309
The group project that I was a part of for SE 309 was the first real software development project that I was a part of during my time as a Software Engineering student at Iowa State. My group and I were tasked with coming up with a project to develop through out the entire semseter that would allow us to put the Agile development cycle into practice and from that we developed an Android app called MemeUP. This app allowed users to connect with one another based on the types and style of memes they liked. I worked primarily on the backend for this project and was able to gain experience with SpringBoot as well as writing server side code. As we went through the semester and development lifecylce, my team and I iteratively designed the components as we needed them but overall followed an Agile process to add new requirements as they were presented to us throughout the semseter. 

### SE 319
The group project that I was a part of for SE 319 was the second time that I was able to gain experience with the Agile development lifecycle as an SE student. This was more of a watered down version of the development lifecycle since it was only half of the semester. But the design process was still present as we developed a project plan that allowed us to prepare an initial set of deliverables. After delivering the initial product, we continued to add functionality to our app as the requirements were expanded. For this project I also worked on the backend development and was able to continue to refine my skills in developing server side code. 

### Cyclone Hours
Cyclone Hours is a personal project that I started working on this past summer to help with students in line for office hours. The idea behind it was to develop a web applicaiton that would create temporary groups students could join and be added to a queue. The students could then specify if they had a question or would like to demo their code. The TA working the office hours would be able to use this information to then be able to better manage a large number of students in their office hours. I am currently still going through the design and development process for this project but approaching it in more of an iterative style. That is, I am working on one page or part of the application at a time, refining it and getting it to a stable point before moving to the next part. This project has allowed me to gain experience with both front and back end development in HTML/CSS, Python, and Flask.
