## Relevant Course Projects
<!-- ====== -->

#### SE 309
The group project that I was a part of for SE 309 was the first real software development project that I was a part of during my time as a Software Engineering student at Iowa State. My group and I were tasked with coming up with a project to develop through out the entire semseter that would allow us to put the Agile development cycle into practice and from that we developed an Android app called MemeUP. This app allowed users to connect with one another based on the types and style of memes they liked. I worked primarily on the backend for this project and was able to gain experience with SpringBoot as well as writing server side code. As we went through the semester and development lifecylce, my team and I iteratively designed the components as we needed them but overall followed an Agile process to add new requirements as they were presented to us throughout the semseter. 

#### SE 319
The group project that I was a part of for SE 319 was the second time that I was able to gain experience with the Agile development lifecycle as an SE student.
